# ScriptLua
Beta Version 0.1

Simple wrapper for lua script
Based on LUA 5.3

The objective is load script and execute specific function, extendending the lua interpreter with our module.

Features:
-Execute Function Lua
-Add basic module at LUA
-Add our module at LUA, written in C

The example to use is main.cpp

I think to used in my next project.
